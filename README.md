# Email-magnet-django

_Email magnet is a simple program that, given a domain name and a personal name, is able
to guess and validate the email adress of such person. 
In order to do that, it creates list with all the possible emails schemes based on the first name,
last name, middle name and initials of those. 
When the list is crated, Email Magnet checks if the emails are valid and if they exist._

_This version of Email Magnet is a web app created with Django Web Framework. In case you're not
interested to deploy this app as a web app, you can check the [Email Magnet version for command line](https://github.com/nestor-san/email_magnet)._
